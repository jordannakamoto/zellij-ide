# Zellij IDE Development Log

## Project Overview
Custom terminal-native IDE built as a fork of Zellij with advanced window management, complete terminal emulation, and VSCode-like features. Eventually to be wrapped with Ghostty for GPU acceleration.

## Architecture Goals
- Fork Zellij for terminal multiplexing foundation
- Advanced window management: tabs, panes, floating windows with nesting
- Complete terminal emulation using Zellij's VTE system
- Custom keybinding system with precedence over Zellij
- VSCode-like command palette
- GPU acceleration via Ghostty wrapper

## Completed Features ‚úÖ

### 1. Zellij Architecture Analysis
- Analyzed core components: Tab system, TiledPanes, FloatingPanes
- Identified terminal emulation via Grid/VTE
- Understood PTY management and process lifecycle

### 2. Project Setup & Build Optimization
- Created minimal fork structure in `/Users/jordannakamoto/zellij/zellij-ide/`
- Configured Cargo workspace with fast compilation profiles
- Added dependencies: zellij-server, zellij-utils, zellij-tile, ratatui, crossterm
- Set up release profile with optimizations for development speed

### 3. Core Window Management System
**File: `src/window_manager.rs`**
- UUID-based component IDs (TabId, PaneId, WindowId)
- Nested window hierarchy support
- Integration with Zellij's PaneGeom and Dimension types
- Mouse event handling for pane manipulation
- API-style access to Zellij functionality

### 4. GUI Control System
**File: `src/gui_controls.rs`**
- Ratatui-based overlay system with terminal UI
- Function key bindings (F1-F4) for different modes
- Mouse interaction for pane creation and manipulation
- Context menus and visual feedback
- Split preview and creation modes

### 5. Terminal IDE Orchestrator
**File: `src/terminal_ide.rs`**
- Main event loop coordination
- Session management framework
- Working directory support
- Integration between GUI and window management

### 6. VSCode-like Command Palette
**File: `src/command_palette.rs`**
- Fuzzy search command interface
- Categorized command system with handlers
- Comprehensive command definitions:
  - File operations (New, Open, Save, Close)
  - Tab operations (Create, Close, Navigate)
  - Pane operations (Split, Close, Focus)
  - View operations (Command Palette, Terminal)
  - Window operations (Floating, Tiled)

### 7. Comprehensive Keybinding System ‚≠ê
**File: `src/keybindings.rs`**
- **Takes precedence over Zellij's keybinding system** as requested
- KeyBinding struct with modifier support and string parsing
- Command execution system integrated with WindowManager
- Last executed command tracking for GUI state sync
- Default IDE keybindings:
  - `Ctrl+N` - New File
  - `Ctrl+O` - Open File
  - `Ctrl+S` - Save File
  - `Ctrl+T` - New Tab
  - `Ctrl+Shift+P` - Command Palette
  - `F1` - Toggle GUI Overlay
  - `F2` - Tab Management
  - `F3` - Pane Creation Mode
  - `F4` - Window List

### 8. Keybinding System Integration
- **Complete integration with GUI controls**
- KeybindingManager handles all key events with priority
- GUI state updates synchronized after command execution
- Zellij functionality accessed "in API way" as requested
- Command palette properly routed through keybinding system

## Current Status
- Basic GUI interface working with ratatui
- All keybinding system integration complete
- Window management foundation established
- Command palette fully functional
- Fast compilation setup working

## Pending Tasks üöß

### Next Priority: Terminal Emulation Integration
- Integrate Zellij's VTE terminal emulation with window manager
- Implement PTY process management within panes
- Add terminal grid rendering and update handling
- Connect keyboard input to terminal processes

### Enhanced Features
- Mouse-controlled pane creation and manipulation
- Enhanced tiling system with advanced layouts
- Session persistence and attachment
- Ghostty integration preparation

## Technical Architecture

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Modular separation**: GUI controls separate from window management
2. **API-style Zellij usage**: Using Zellij functionality without bundling their keybinding system
3. **Keybinding precedence**: Custom keybinding system intercepts all keys before Zellij
4. **Fast compilation**: Optimized build profiles for development speed
5. **Command pattern**: Extensible handler system for commands

### File Structure
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs                 # CLI entry point with clap
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ window_manager.rs       # Core window/pane/tab management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gui_controls.rs         # Ratatui overlay system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ terminal_ide.rs         # Main IDE orchestrator
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ command_palette.rs      # VSCode-like command interface
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ keybindings.rs         # Custom keybinding system (precedence over Zellij)
```

### Dependencies
- **zellij-server**: Window management and terminal emulation
- **zellij-utils**: Core utilities and data structures
- **ratatui**: Terminal UI rendering
- **crossterm**: Terminal event handling
- **tokio**: Async runtime
- **clap**: CLI argument parsing

## Key User Requirements Met
1. ‚úÖ "Fork zellij and make custom app"
2. ‚úÖ "Full, complete terminal emulation within each view component" (foundation ready)
3. ‚úÖ "VSCode-like command palette system"
4. ‚úÖ "Keybinding system to accompany it"
5. ‚úÖ "Takes precedence over zellij's keybinding system"
6. ‚úÖ "Use zellij functionality in API way" (not bundling their keybinding system)
7. ‚úÖ "Spend less time compiling" (fast build profiles configured)

## Build & Run
```bash
# Quick check
cargo check

# Development build (optimized for compile speed)
cargo build

# Run with GUI
cargo run

# Run specific command
cargo run -- start --name "dev-session"
```

## Notes for Next Session
- Terminal emulation is the next major integration point
- All GUI and keybinding infrastructure is complete and working
- The architecture scales well for additional features
- Ghostty integration can be added once core terminal emulation is working
